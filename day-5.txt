-> Node.js Start.

-> write some code during the session and as well as after.
-> Node
  -> Built on V8 engine.
  -> REPL
     -> R - Read
     -> E - Eval
     -> P - Print
     -> L - Loop
  
  -> enter "node" in terminal and enter to enter into REPL
  -> Different with browser JS ecosystem. 
     -> For ex:- Browser dependent methods like Document.getElementById is unavailable.
  -> All core JS methods are avaialable along with Node API extras.
    -> ex: console.log, Arrays, Loops etc.
    
    -> Some easily available methods.
       -> To clear the console.log in REPL -> enter "console.clear()" 
       -> .help -> to get the help screen.
       -> .editor -> to open an cmd line editor to write more than one line of code.
       	  -> Ctrl+D -> TO run the written code and exit the cmd line editor.
       -> _ -> to display last result -> only works on REPL shell.
       -> Tab(press tab 2 times) -> To display the list of methods available.
       
   -> fs Module:
   	-> fs.readdirSync(os.homedir()) -> To read a directory at the given path.
   	-> fs.readfileSync -> to read a file.
   	
   -> How to write scripts in node.js and execute them.
   	-> on REPL all packages and modules are readily available because everything is loaded at start itself but while writing a script we need to import he required packages.
   	 -> ex: const os = require("os");
   	 
   -> Can Node do launch any applications(process), open URL's etc.. ?
   	-> Yes. There's a package called process in node which can be used to do the above mentioned operations.
   	
   -> Setting the mode of environment in nodeJS:
   	-> NODE_ENV = development or any type of env.
   
   -> The Modern Javascript:
   	-> Use of String literals
   	-> Use of const instead of var.
   	
   	-> ECMA
   	   -> var, let, const, 
   	   -> Earlier there was no concept of using classes in JS but fro ECMA Script we can use classes.
   	   
   	   -> THIS keyword:
   	   	-> "this" keyword has it's own scope.
   	   	-> when used inside a function the scope of this changes.
   	   	-> to solve this use "Arrow Functions".
